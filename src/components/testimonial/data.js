She is patient, very simple and always there to know if there is any problem and then find a solution to it ... I would recommend her to anyone because she has the spirit to teach and inspire people around her.",

She made it her responsibility to carry all her students along and ever ready to answer all questions in a more explanatory manner. She was friendly and had a close relationship with all her students. She showed genuine concern towards all and thought without reservations. I benefited a lot from Chiamaka’s teaching and would recommend her to all who are willing to learn Frontend skill.",

Albeit, Chiamaka helped guide me through my front end Learning journey whereas reducing the difficulties I may have encountered.  She was very patient. She still is, cause technically,  I'm not done with Learning yet. But she's such a good tutor."
